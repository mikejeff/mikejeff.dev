		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Spring is here, and I’m gearing up for some yard projects. My yard looks like shit right now, but I get a lot of satisfaction from a good Spring cleanup. Beyond that, I want to get the bushes and trees around our house tidied up. Also, my current setup makes woodworking in the colder months difficult, so I’m looking forward to getting back into that. I plan to build a giant sandbox for my son… either a kit or out of lumber; I haven’t decided yet. I think I’m going to start taking woodworking classes at Woodcraft within this Spring and Summer — I’m hoping that will give me a jumpstart. I’m thinking that to get deeper into woodworking, I might need to get more into working with hand tools since space to work and noise are barriers to me getting anything done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;media&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Media &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://mikejeff.dev/posts/vibe-check_20230330/#media&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mikejeff.dev/img/posts/last_of_us.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Scene from &amp;quot;The Last of Us&amp;quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We finished up the &lt;em&gt;Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; along with the rest of the world — What a fantastic show! At the time the game was published, I wasn’t doing much gaming beyond &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy 11&lt;/em&gt;, so I missed out. The show has made me want to get a console (or a more powerful “work” computer 😉) and play the game series. This is the first show since &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt; that has made me want to get into the source material and get ahead of the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;coding&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Coding &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://mikejeff.dev/posts/vibe-check_20230330/#coding&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After two or so years running mainly PopOS!, I’ve gone back to Windows. I found Pop to be a nice desktop experience; I like it, and I’m sure I’ll find a reason to go back to it. My issue is that Windows offers some comforts out of the box that I had to search for, and sometime couldn’t find on Linux. Windows Power Toys is &lt;strong&gt;nice&lt;/strong&gt;. Some of the features in there have become staples in my toolbox, and I know I haven’t scratched the surface. The old saying of “Linux is free if you don’t value your time” feels harsh because Linux is a great tool, but it’s true. I spent hours researching and testing apps to replace some of the comforts Windows offers, but I wasn’t able to approximate enough of what I need to maximize my productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All that said, I think Windows sucks for a lot of what I do for local development. For now I turned an old laptop into an Ubuntu-based dev server. I’m loving it right now. I know there are options out there to containerize projects like Docker, but I haven’t gotten there yet. It’s hard to keep up with web development technology, and for now, I’m fine with being far behind the cutting edge so long as I can deliver value to my clients. After all, we are craftsmen and we get to choose what tools we use to get the job done. Operating systems, applications, and coding languages are all just that — tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;music&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Music &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://mikejeff.dev/posts/vibe-check_20230330/#music&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mikejeff.dev/img/posts/hwm.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Chuck Ragan of Hot Water Music&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been heavy into Hot Water Music and Against me lately. Listening to playlists on repeat and playing along on guitar. I was so into Punk music when I was younger, but at some point, I kind of lost interest in seeking out music that was outside of whatever the mainstream radio stations (and Pandora) were playing. I wasn’t active in my listening, just kind of creating a backing track to my days. As I build my record collection and actively seek out new music to listen to, I’m coming to regret that lost time. Some of these bands I’m finding have been around for decades, and I’m sad that I’m discovering them this late.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;pedals&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Pedals &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://mikejeff.dev/posts/vibe-check_20230330/#pedals&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://mikejeff.dev/img/posts/bad_monkey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Bad Monkey Pedal with Chinese characters&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About a week ago, Josh Scott of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jhspedals.info/&quot;&gt;JHS Pedals&lt;/a&gt; broke the (guitar) internet with his video comparing the Digitech Bad Monkey to some of the most legendary overdrives in the history of effects pedals. The Bad Monkey (named after Curious George) is a take on the Tube Screamer circuit, but instead of one tone control, you get a two band eq with high and low controls. It came out in the early 2000’s, was affordable at the time, and has been discontinued for years. Up until two weeks ago, they were on the used market for about $50 to $70. Since the video, where Josh proved that it can sound similar, if not identical to expensive, sought after overdrives, the price has skyrocketed and now costs hundreds of dollars on the used market. His influence on the pedal market is astounding and hilarious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a pedal junkie, and it’s still crazy to me that people will pay that much money for one. Especially one that could be had for fifty bucks before his video dropped. Afterward, Josh came out and basically said that this is madness, just have fun with what you have and play. On top of that, another view I’ve heard/read is that the video proves that there is tons of overlap in the functionality of overdrive pedals. With some time and tweaking, you can find your sound in many of them — even the cheap ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I like to stack two overdrives, and have found that I can get a version of “my tone” with different combinations. I think the most expensive one I have was probably seventy bucks new. I have even gotten some fun overdrive, boost and fuzz sounds from my Line 6 M5. All that said, I’m a mediocre bedroom player, but I’d be fine taking any of these combinations I’ve tried to a gig or a jam session.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit, though, the Chinese version of the Bad Monkey with Chinese Characters in place of the English ones is mighty!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;December always seems to start off slow, then take off like a rocket once I find that I’m running out of shipping days to get my Christmas shopping done. Now Christmas is in the rearview, and just like that, it’s almost a new year. I haven’t been much of a “New Year’s Resolution” guy for most of my life, and as life goes on, I’ve realized that it’s damn near impossible to flip a switch on January first and change your life forever. It’s good to have a goals though (you don’t even have to wait for the new year to start working towards them.) These past months, I’ve tried to read more, and watch a little less TV. Be more active in my learning and entertainment. Thus far, it’s going well, and I’ll try my best to sustain it until it’s part of who I am and what I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that taking a break from work to play music made me more productive, and more creative. It must be some of that left brain/right brain stuff. I won’t pretend to understand it, I know that it gives me a boost when I need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;listened&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Listened &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://mikejeff.dev/posts/vibe-check_20221230/#listened&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re starting a record collection! It’s right on trend, but I’m not ashamed. I haven&#39;t amassed a large number of records yet, but I’m sure I will soon. For now, I am looking forward to growing my back catalog of music I loved as a kid. In fact, as a Christmas gift, I received a copy of Nirvana’s “In Utero” packaged with a couple of flannel shirts. My life has come full circle! Also, I picked up the mp3 album of “Some Girls” by The Rolling Stones. It’s full of classic ‘Stones bangers, and it’s moody as hell. I’ll admit that I’m late coming around to these guys. It’s embarrassing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;read&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Read &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://mikejeff.dev/posts/vibe-check_20221230/#read&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read “The Last Ronin” — it’s a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comic by Kevin Eastman. Eastman is one of the original co-creators of the Turtles, back before the original cartoon got huge. I was a fan as a kid, and when I saw this new book, I had to get it. It tells the story of the end of the feud between Splinter’s family and the family of The Shredder. It&#39;s post-apocalyptic, gritty, and violent. Nothing like the pizza loving Turtles of the late 80’s and 90’s, it’s a return to the grit exuded by the original comic. It&#39;s exceptional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For work, I’m reading “Don’t Make Me Think.” It’s about usability on websites and how to remove as much friction as possible from a user’s experience. It’s pretty common sense stuff, but it’s full of good examples and some pretty dated imagery. It’s an important subject to me, so I’m cruising right through it. I’ll probably re-read it when I’m done to get a more detailed understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;watched&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Watched &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://mikejeff.dev/posts/vibe-check_20221230/#watched&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month was all Christmas-themed viewing. We watched lots of Christmas themed cartoons and a couple of classic movies; Nothing earth shattering, but I enjoyed lots of time spent with my family.&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was shooting for a once a month update with these Vibe Checks, but I failed in the second month. Josh Scott of JHS pedals said in a live stream that there’s not enough failing in public because social media is all about showing a curated version of yourself. I agree, though I do see people documenting their struggles more now than ever before. It&#39;s hard to see much of it on my Twitter and Instagram feeds, but it&#39;s helpful and inspirational to watch people struggle and overcome massive challenges. Fortunately, the complexities of my life are trivial by comparison. I need to stop binge watching “Dahmer” and start dedicating more time to writing and creating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Halloween was this week! We went trick or treating with my youngest son, who dressed as “Spin” aka “Spiderman: Miles Morales”, and we had fun! Thankfully, we have a nice neighborhood for trick or treating, and our neighbors go all out. We even got a pretty good scare from a guy in an 8 foot tall ghoul costume standing silently by a bowl of candy. I know what I’m doing next year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;watched&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Watched &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://mikejeff.dev/posts/vibe-check_20221102/#watched&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These past weeks, I’ve been watching “Dahmer.” It&#39;s creepy and messed up in all sorts of ways. I appreciate how they’ve broken the story up and used different characters’ points of view  to tell the story. I feel a sense of guilt watching it because it’s a story about the killing of 18 people. It’s strange to say the least that someone thought to make entertainment out of this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tales of the Jedi dropped last week and I managed to binge it. I Loved it! Dave Filioni is an amazing creator. I am always blown away by his creativity, and story telling as he and the rest of the Star Wars team continue to flesh out the Galaxy Far, Far Away. As for this series, I&#39;m surpirsed to find that I enjoyed Dooku as a sympathetic character. We actually get to see how and why he becomes a Sith apprentice, and it makes some sense. Now, I need to google why he&#39;s called “Count Dooku” in Episode II! &lt;em&gt;I googled it: My conclusion is that the original actor, Christopher Lee, was well known for playing Count Dracula before working on Star Wars. Also, “Darth Dooku” would sound silly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;read&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Read &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://mikejeff.dev/posts/vibe-check_20221102/#read&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I need to read more, and keep track of it. I have two Javascript books on my desk, but they haven’t seen any action in a while. I’ve wanted to get some books on UX, I might pull the trigger on one or two soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;music&quot; tabindex=&quot;-1&quot;&gt;Music &lt;a class=&quot;direct-link&quot; href=&quot;https://mikejeff.dev/posts/vibe-check_20221102/#music&quot; aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve gotten way into The Bouncing Souls, so I bought their album from 2001, How I Spent My Summer Vacation and had it on repeat for over a week. I am truly a sucker for anthemic Punk Rock!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took a stab at learning the guitar solo from “Back in Black” by AC/DC. I got through the first five phrases playing along with Marty Music &lt;em&gt;(obviously).&lt;/em&gt; I wish he was around when I was learning guitar as a kid, he is a great guitar teacher! I’m amazed at what I can play after following along with him. Practice makes perfect, kids!&lt;/p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;You guys, I’m doing it &lt;em&gt;again.&lt;/em&gt; I’m re-starting the blog on a new platform with the hope that I’ll be able to stick to it now. My youngest son is a bit older now, and I’m sleeping better, and I feel as if I have a bit more free time on my hands to create something. I have always had trouble trying to laser-focus in on one project, so I’m expecting this to be a little scattershot. I’m going to embrace that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m trying to become a better developer, dad, musician, and person, so expect lots of content in those areas. Also, I think in the past, I’ve tried to narrow the scope of my blog so much that it became uninteresting to me, so you can expect to see me write about other subjects as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First week of school: I have a quiet house again. My home “office” has no door, so it can be difficult to separate myself from whoever is home with me while I’m working. It’s a double-edged sword — it’s great that I get to spend &lt;strong&gt;tons&lt;/strong&gt; of time with my family, but there are times where I need to focus and to be honest, that’s hard to do when there’s people doing their thing nearby. I’m happy to have some structure back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New (to me) album: Tim Timebomb and Friends. It’s probably a about a decade old at this point, but there’s a ton of tracks on this album that I had never heard before. It&#39;s kind of Rancid-esque, but also included is Tim Armstrong doing first wave ska — mellow-ish, full horn section most of the time, and lots of guest performers. It’s darn good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m back on Noom after an indulgent summer (our first summer of doing our normal road trips and vacations since the Covid Pandemic hit.) I can gain weight fast, but, it comes off pretty quick too with a little discipline. Noom is great for that. Basically, it makes you log your food and drink intake and gives you a calorie allowance. It’s supposed to kind of retrain you to be able to think about your eating habits and make good food choices. It’s an effective weight loss tool, I need to be better about sustaining the good habits I’m forming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not much of a recreational reader, but I’m trying to do better because it’s such an important method of gathering information and learning. I’ve been trying to make a habit of reading at least one article each day on web development, or at least technology in general. I find myself gravitated to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://daverupert.com/&quot;&gt;personal blog of Dave Rupert&lt;/a&gt;. I have learned so much about web development from him and his podcast cohort, Chris Coyier (founder of &lt;a href=&quot;https://css-tricks.com/&quot;&gt;CSS Tricks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://codepen.io/&quot;&gt;Code Pen&lt;/a&gt;) over the years. If you’re looking for some inspiration, or to learn the latest in web development, these guys deliver, and they seem like good people to boot. At this moment, I am emulating blogging techniques I learned about on his site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s a wrap for now. Let me know if you saw this post, and what you thought of it — hit me up on Twitter @fellaroonie.&lt;/p&gt;
